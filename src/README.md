## Evaluating the Gulordava et al., (2018) model on the BLiMP corpus (https://github.com/alexwarstadt/blimp)

This section describes how to use the Gulordava et al., (2018) LSTM model as a benchmark for the BLiMP corpus. The original README on how to run the experiments in Gulordava et al. are shown in the next section.

In preparation, download the BLiMP dataset. The scripts currently assume that the jsonl files are downloaded to `../data/blimp/jsonl`. Also, download the pretrained English language model and the English data from [data and pre-trained model](../data). The scripts currently assume that the pretrained checkpoint is placed in `../models` and the data is placed in `../data/lm/English`

First, run `python BLiMP_scripts/jsonl_to_txt.py` to (1) convert the jsonl files into txt and (2) tokenize the data.

Second, run `python BLiMP_scripts/BLiMP_commands_gen.py` to create shell scripts for the evaluation experiments on NYU's HPC clusters. The python commands in the shell scripts can be used in other computational settings.

To obtain per-word LM probability and entropy for further analysis, run `sbatch BLiMP_scripts/commands_by_token.sh`. The results are saved to`../results`. 

Run `python BLiMP_scripts/parse_by_token.py` to parse the by_token results for analyzing the probabilities and entropy of the critical word, the prefixes, and the appendixes for the one-prefix and two-prefix evaluation methods.

The R script for analyzing per-sentence or per-segment LM probabilities is in `../analysis/analysis_parsed_dir.r`.


## Original readme from Gulordava et al., (2018)

This directory contains the scripts we used to run our experiments:

- the `syntactic_testsets` directory contains scripts to extract constructions and generate nonce sentences
  - please check  `create_testset.sh` to see how these scripts are used and put together
- the `language_models` directory contains scripts for training and evaluating language models (standard and n-gram LSTMs) using PyTorch (0.3), based on the code [https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model)
- the `data` directory contains scripts for treebank preprocessing



### Usage example

*works with python 3.5, pandas 0.22*

#### Creating evaluation datasets

Download LM Wikipedia data to `../data/lm/English/` and run `create_testset.sh` with default paths to obtain evaluation data files with prefix `tmp/English/generated`. 

Our generated data tested in the paper is in `../data/agreement/English/generated`. (Since random substitution for nonce sentences is used, these files won't be identical to newly produced files, but the original sentences extracted should be the same if you use the English UD 2.0 treebank.)

#### Evaluating a language model

You can use your trained `model.pt` or download our [pre-trained best model](../data).

Run the command (`--cuda` is optional)

```bash
python language_models/evaluate_target_word.py --data ../data/lm/English/ --checkpoint model.pt --path ../data/agreement/English/generated --suffix best_model --cuda
```

to produce the tab-delimited file `../data/agreement/English/generated.output_best_model` with probabilities for target word positions. The value of `--suffix` argument is used as the name of the column containing model probabilities.

Run `python results.py English best_model` to obtain a summary of performance for `best_model` (the column name) extracted from the output file (works with default paths). 

*Note:* this workflow made sense for our evaluations but is not the most direct way to obtain accuracy numbers. We might provide a simplified script for evaluation in the future.
